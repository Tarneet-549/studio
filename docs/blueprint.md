# **App Name**: PyClarity

## Core Features:

- Pattern Recognition: Use machine learning models to identify common obfuscation patterns such as variable renaming and control flow changes. The AI model will act as a tool to suggest and apply deobfuscation methods.
- Context-Aware Analysis: Employ NLP to understand the context of the code, allowing for accurate deobfuscation even with encrypted variable and function names.
- Code Comparison: Provide a side-by-side code comparison view to track changes between the original and deobfuscated code.
- Light/Dark Mode UI: Implement a user-friendly interface with both light and dark mode options.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm blue (#3498db) for readability and trust.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#ecf0f1) for backgrounds to reduce eye strain.
- Accent: Green (#2ecc71) to indicate successful deobfuscation or suggested improvements.
- Split-screen layout for comparing obfuscated and deobfuscated code side by side.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent different functions and options.

## Original User Request:
AI-powered deobfuscation for Python is a process of automatically reversing the obfuscation techniques applied to Python code, making it more understandable and human-readable. Here are the key features that make such tools impactful and unique:

1. Pattern Recognition with ML Models
Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks) to identify obfuscation patterns such as variable renaming, function mangling, or control flow changes. The model can automatically suggest or apply deobfuscation methods.

2. Context-Aware Analysis
AI models can analyze the context of variable usage, improving the understanding of the codeâ€™s functionality even when names and structures are altered.

3. Code Simplification
Automatically removes unnecessary complexity introduced by obfuscation, such as redundant code blocks or artificial complexity, making the code more intuitive.

4. Semantic Understanding
Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) or deep learning to gain a semantic understanding of the code logic, enabling more accurate deobfuscation even when variable and function names are encrypted.

5. Error Detection & Debugging Assistance
Provides real-time feedback on potential errors in deobfuscated code, highlighting inconsistencies and suggesting improvements to make the code work as intended.

6. Light/Dark Mode UI for Better Accessibility
A user-friendly interface with light/dark mode, which enhances the experience, especially when reviewing large pieces of obfuscated code.

7. Code Comparison and Reversion
Offers the ability to compare the original obfuscated code with the deobfuscated version, tracking changes and reversion processes to ensure accuracy.

8. Integration with IDEs
Seamlessly integrates into popular Python IDEs like VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter, allowing developers to deobfuscate directly in their workflow without leaving the development environment.

9. Customizable Deobfuscation Levels
Offers adjustable deobfuscation levels, where users can choose the extent to which the code is simplified, from partial to full deobfuscation, based on their needs.

These features make AI for Python deobfuscation a powerful tool for improving code security, readability, and maintainability.
